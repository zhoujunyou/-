### CountDownLatch

* count 就是AQS中state的值
* await()方法会在AQS的同步队列中添加一个共享结点 并阻塞线程
* countDown()方法会让state-1 到state=0时 会去释放同步队列中的线程。如果下个是共享结点也去释放。

 AbstractQueuedSynchronizer

```java
/**
 * Acquires in shared interruptible mode.
 * @param arg the acquire argument
 */
private void doAcquireSharedInterruptibly(int arg)
    throws InterruptedException {
    //AQS同步队列加一个Node.SHARED
    final Node node = addWaiter(Node.SHARED);
    boolean failed = true;
    try {
        for (;;) {
            final Node p = node.predecessor();
            if (p == head) {
                int r = tryAcquireShared(arg);
                if (r >= 0) {
                    setHeadAndPropagate(node, r);
                    p.next = null; // help GC
                    failed = false;
                    return;
                }
            }
            if (shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire(p, node) &&
                parkAndCheckInterrupt())
                throw new InterruptedException();
        }
    } finally {
        if (failed)
            cancelAcquire(node);
    }
}
```

 AbstractQueuedSynchronizer

```java
/**
 * Sets head of queue, and checks if successor may be waiting
 * in shared mode, if so propagating if either propagate > 0 or
 * PROPAGATE status was set.
 *
 * @param node the node
 * @param propagate the return value from a tryAcquireShared
 */
private void setHeadAndPropagate(Node node, int propagate) {
    Node h = head; // Record old head for check below
    setHead(node);
    /*
     * Try to signal next queued node if:
     *   Propagation was indicated by caller,
     *     or was recorded (as h.waitStatus either before
     *     or after setHead) by a previous operation
     *     (note: this uses sign-check of waitStatus because
     *      PROPAGATE status may transition to SIGNAL.)
     * and
     *   The next node is waiting in shared mode,
     *     or we don't know, because it appears null
     *
     * The conservatism in both of these checks may cause
     * unnecessary wake-ups, but only when there are multiple
     * racing acquires/releases, so most need signals now or soon
     * anyway.
     */
    if (propagate > 0 || h == null || h.waitStatus < 0 ||
        (h = head) == null || h.waitStatus < 0) {
        Node s = node.next;
        //下个结点满足条件release
        if (s == null || s.isShared())
            doReleaseShared();
    }
}
```

CountDownLatch

```java
protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int releases) {
    // Decrement count; signal when transition to zero
    for (;;) {
        int c = getState();
        if (c == 0)

        if (compareAndSetState(c, nextc))
            return nextc == 0;
    }
}
```



```java

 * Release action for shared mode -- signals successor and ensures
 * propagation. (Note: For exclusive mode, release just amounts
 * to calling unparkSuccessor of head if it needs signal.)
 */
private void doReleaseShared() {

     * in-progress acquires/releases.  This proceeds in the usual
     * way of trying to unparkSuccessor of head if it needs

     * ensure that upon release, propagation continues.
     * Additionally, we must loop in case a new node is added
     * while we are doing this. Also, unlike other uses of
