### 获取进程线程信息

当发生 ANR 的时候，Android 系统会打印 CPU 相关的信息到日志中，使用的是[ProcessCpuTracker](http://androidxref.com/9.0.0_r3/xref/frameworks/base/core/java/com/android/internal/os/ProcessCpuTracker.java)

这样好像并没有权限可以拿到其他应用进程的 CPU 信息

当发现应用的某个进程 CPU 使用率比较高的时候，可以通过下面几个文件检查该进程下各个线程的 CPU 使用率，继而统计出该进程各个线程的时间占比。

 [Linux环境下进程的CPU占用率](http://www.samirchen.com/linux-cpu-performance/)

/proc/[pid]/stat             // 进程 CPU 使用情况

/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/stat  // 进程下面各个线程的 CPU 使用情况

/proc/[pid]/sched            // 进程 CPU 调度相关

/proc/loadavg                // 系统平均负载，uptime 命令对应文件



已将这部分逻辑加入网管监控中。代码cn.mwee.android.skynet.appruninfo.util.ProcessCpuTracker

如果需要获取线程信息打开开关 会获取以下信息](http://www.samirchen.com/linux-cpu-performance/)

上面是美易点业务中心的线程信息 。上面可以发现有几个重复的线程，bugly线程都重复了一次。这是由于不同classloader下 分别init了一次bugly。[Android性能优化-线程性能优化](http://www.lightskystreet.com/2016/10/18/android-optimize-thread/)

**线程不是免费的：它们占用内存。每个线程最少消耗64k内存。如果设备上安装了许多应用，该值就会快速添加，特别是在调用栈显著增长的情况下**
